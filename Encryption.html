<h1>Encryption</h1>
<h2>What is Encryption?</h2>
<p>Encryption is the method of a readable data called "plaintext" into different format, which can be only understood by the authorized person, in more simple way, it's the operation of converting plaintext into cipher text using mathimcatical operations. Encryption is a reversable operation, so it can be reversed to get the plaintext again, and this operation is called decryption.</p>

<p>Encryption algorithms uses encryption key for the encryption process, which has to be owned by both sender and receiver. It's used while encryption and decrption.</p>

<p>Cipher text seems to be random and sure unreadable, but it's the output of mathimatical operations, and also predictable, So each time the same algorithm is used to encrypt the same plaintext using the same encryption key, will generate the same cipher text.</p>

<h2>Encryption Algorithm</h2>
<p>The mathematical formula used for transforming data into ciphertext is an encryption algorithm. An algorithm will use the key to predictably alter the data, so that even if the encrypted data appears random, it can be turned back into plaintext again using the key.</p>

<h2>Why Encryption is needed?</h2>

<p>Encryption is used to fulfill some security aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Privacy:</b> Encryption ensures no one, except the intended recipient or proper data owner, can read messages or data at rest. It avoids the collection and reading of confidential data by cyber criminals, ad networks, Internet service providers and even governments.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Security:</b> Encryption supports in case of theft of data, whether the data is in transit or in rest. When a corporate computer is lost or stolen, and its hard drive is correctly secured, it is possible that the data on that computer will remain secure. Similarly, encrypted communications allow the communicating parties to share confidential information without leaking the data. Encryption also helps prevent malicious activities like Man In The Middle (MITM) from occurring.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Authentication:</b> The public key encryption establishes, among other things, that the origin server of a website owns the private key and therefore has been given an SSL certificate legitimately</p></li>

<li><p><b>Regulations:</b> Most industry and government laws allow organizations that manage user data to keep their data encrypted for all of these purposes. HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and the GDPR are examples of regulatory and compliance standards that require encryption.</p></li>
</ul>
