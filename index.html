<h1>What is Cryptography?</h1>

<p>Cryptography is a technique of protecting knowledge and communication by the use of codes, so that it can only be interpreted and processed by those for whom the information is intended. Therefore the unauthorized access to information is avoided. The "crypt" means "hidden" and "graphic" means "writing".</p>

<p>The techniques used to encrypt information in cryptography are derived from mathematical principles and a series of rule-based calculations known as algorithms to transform messages in ways that make it difficult to decipher them.Such algorithms are used for key generation cryptography, digital signature, data privacy authentication, internet browsing and the security of sensitive data.</p>

<h1>Featrues of Cryptogaphy</h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Confidentiality:</b> Information can only be accessed by the person it is intended for and no other one can access it, except him.</li>
	<li><b>Integrity:</b> Information can not be altered in storage or transfer between sender and intended receiver without detecting any addition to information.</li>
	<li><b>Non-repudiation:</b> The creator/sender of information cannot deny his or her intention to send information at later stage.</li>
	<li><b>Authentication:</b> The identities of sender and receiver are confirmed. As well as destination/origin of information is confirmed.</li>
</ul>
