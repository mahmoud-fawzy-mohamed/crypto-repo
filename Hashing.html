<h1>Hashing</h1>
<h2>What is Hashing?</h2>
<p>Hashing is the transformation of readable data with variable length into fixed-length unreadble data, that represent the orginal plaintext input data. Hashing is irreverable operation, so the result of the hash function or operation, can not be used to get the plaintext input data again. The relationship between plaintext and it's hash, is one-to-one, So the generated hash for the same message will still the same.</p>

<h2>Why Hashing is needed?</h2>
<p>Unlike Encryption, which is used to ensure data security and privacy that no one would get the plaintext data except the real receiver, but if someone could break the used encryption algorithm, so he can modify the message and the receiver would not know.</p>

<p>Hashing is used to verify the intergrity, so it verifies that the message is never changed during the journey from the sender to receiver.</p>

<p>Hashing is also can be using in other things than security and intgerity verification.</p>
<p>By creating a hash for the plaintext message and send it with the message, when the receiver get the message, he will calculate the hash for it then compare it with the received hash, if equal, so the message was not changed while tranferring.</p>

<h2>Hashing Algorithm</h2>
<h3>Defination</h3>
<p>A hashing algorithm is a method of hash cryptography. It is a mathematical algorithm mapping arbitrary-size data to a fixed-size hash. It is designed to be a one-way, invertable function. Nonetheless, many hashing algorithms have been compromised in recent years. This was the case with the MD5.</p>

<p>Even with the smallest change (one letter) the whole hash is different</p>
<br>
<h3>cryptographic hash function features:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>For any form of data it should be easy to calculate the hash value</li>
	<li>Regenerating a message from its hash value (brute force attack being the only option) should not be possible</li>
	<li>It should avoid collisions with hash, with each message having its own hash</li>
	<li>Every change to a message should change its hash value, even the smallest one. It should be altogether different. The avalanche effect is called</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h2>Types of Hashing</h2>
<p>There are several different kinds of hash algorithms, such as RipeMD, Tiger, xxhash and more, but MD5, SHA-2 and CRC32 are the most common kind of hashing used for file integrity checks.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>MD5:</b>The MD5 hash function encodes and encodes a string of information into a 128-bit fingerprint. MD5 is commonly used as a check sum for data integrity verification. Because of its age, however, MD5 is often considered to suffer from severe vulnerabilities in hash collisions, however it is nevertheless one of the world's most commonly used algorithms.</li>
	<li><b>SHA-2:</b> developed by the National Security Agency ( NSA), is a method of cryptographic hash. SHA-2 makes major improvements to its predecessor, SHA-1. The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with 224, 256, 384 or 512 bit digests (hash values): SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256.</li>
	<li><b>CRC32:</b> Cyclic redundancy test (CRC) is an error detection application which is also used to detect unintended data changes. Encoding the same data string using CRC32 will always result in the same hash performance, so often CRC32 is used as a hash algorithm for verifying file integrity. CRC32 is seldom used outside of Zip files these days.</li>
</ul>
