<h1>Hashing</h1>
<h2>What is Hashing?</h2>
<p>Hashing is the transformation of readable data with variable length into fixed-length unreadble data, that represent the orginal plaintext input data. Hashing is irreverable operation, so the result of the hash function or operation, can not be used to get the plaintext input data again.</p>

<h2>Why Hashing is needed?</h2>
<p>Unlike Encryption, which is used to ensure data security and privacy that no one would get the plaintext data except the real receiver, but if someone could break the used encryption algorithm, so he can modify the message and the receiver would not know.</p>

<p>Hashing is used to verify the intergrity, so it verifies that the message is never changed during the journey from the sender to receiver.</p>

<p>Hashing is laso can be using in other things than security and intgerity verification.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>How it works?</h2>
<p>By creating a hash for the plaintext message and send it with the message, when the receiver get the message, he will calculate the hash for it then compare it with the received hash, if equal, so the message was not changed while tranferring.</p>
